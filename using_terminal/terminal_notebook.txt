Why must I never type the command rm -rf?

What does the command pwd -> print working directory mean? 
- Tells you the directory you are currently working in

I deleted a folder off my desktop using the command rmdir but it's not in my trashcan, where did it go?

When I use the command ls to list what's on my desktop, there seems to be a file still on there that I thought I had deleted weeks ago. Why is it still listed on my desktop? How can I get rid of it?

What does the command pushd -> push directory mean?
What does the command popd -> pop directory mean?

What does the command dirs mean? Does it mean the same as the command pwd?
pwd is more specific whereas dirs is less specific

What does the command less mean?
- Less is a much better way to inspect large files on the command line. You’ll get a screen-full of text at a time, but no more. You can move a line up or a line down with the k and j respectively, and move a window up or down with b and f. You can search for a pattern by typing /pattern. When you’re done, hit q to exit the less viewer.
