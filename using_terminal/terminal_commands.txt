Terminal Commands

clear -> clears everything as if you just opened terminal from the beginning
pwd -> print working directory; tells you the directory you are currently working in
hostname -> my computer's network name
mkdir [folder name] -> creates a folder or new directory
rmdir [folder name] -> removes folder or directory
touch [file name e.g test.txt] -> creates a file
touch .[file name e.g test.txt] -> the . in front of the name of the file makes it a hidden file
mate [. or name of file or folder] -> open that item in textmate
ls -> lists the contents of the folder or directory
ls -a -> lists all files even hidden ones

cp -> copy a file or directory
mv -> move a file or directory
cat -> prints a whole file in terminal
less -> scrolls through a file once printed; it's a much better way to inspect large files on the command line. You’ll get a screen-full of text at a time, but no more. You can move a line up or a line down with the k and j respectively, and move a window up or down with b and f. You can search for a pattern by typing /pattern. When you’re done, hit q to exit the less viewer.
find -> find files
grep -> finds things inside files
find * | grep [word e.g pikachu] -> finds files with the keyword; in this case with the word pikachu
cat * | grep [word e.g pikachu] -> finds keyword in the file; in this case it will find every instance of the word pikachu in the file

apropos -> finds what man page is appropriate
en -> look at your environment
export -> export/set a new environment variable
