Terminal Commands


NOTE: When there is a black dot next to the name of a file opened in TextMate, it means that the file has not been saved. To save all unsaved files; Go to File -> Save All

cd [directory name] -> changes your directory
cd .. -> goes back one directory
cd ../.. -> goes back two directories
cd ../../.. -> goes back three directories
cd [~] -> goes home; as if you just opened terminal from the beginning
clear -> clears everything as if you just began to use the previous directory
pwd -> prints working directory; tells you the directory you are currently working in
hostname -> my computer's network name
mkdir [folder name] -> creates a folder or new directory
rmdir [folder name] -> removes folder or directory
touch [file name e.g. test.txt] -> creates a file
touch .[file name e.g. test.txt] -> the . in front of the name of the file makes it a hidden file
mate [. or name of file or folder] -> opens that item in textmate with all the folders inside it so that it is displayed neatly on the left and then the files you choose to open stay in one window on TextMate on tabs instead of seperate windows. This is also ideal because you can also check which files you have changed by the icons that will appear on the folders or files displayed on the left. You can first change to the directory you want to open in TextMate before entering the command; [e.g. cd Desktop/learning_python_the_hard_way/ press enter mate . press enter] or mate Desktop/learning_python_the_hard_way/ then press enter
NOTE: the . means to open everything within that directory. This is true for other commands which use the . [e.g. git add .] since this command means to add everything to GitHub 
ls -> lists the contents of the folder or directory
ls -a -> lists all files even hidden ones
rm -rf [file name] -> removes files; you can also drag and drop the file instead of writing it
python [name of python file] -> run python file; you can also drag and drop the file instead of writing it
cp -> copy a file or directory
mv -> move a file or directory
cat -> prints a whole file in terminal
less -> scrolls through a file once printed; it's a much better way to inspect large files on the command line. You’ll get a screen-full of text at a time, but no more. You can move a line up or a line down with the k and j respectively, and move a window up or down with b and f. You can search for a pattern by typing /pattern. When you’re done, hit q to exit the less viewer.
find -> finds files
grep -> finds things inside files
find * | grep [word e.g. pikachu] -> finds files with the keyword; in this case with the word pikachu
cat * | grep [word e.g. pikachu] -> finds keyword in the file; in this case it will find every instance of the word pikachu in the file
find / -name [file name e.g. test.txt] -> finds the file by searching your entire computer. If you don't know the file extension of a file you want to search for then type * next to the name of the file; [find / -name test*] and then press enter
man [command your curious about e.g. find] -> stands for manual and it simply prints a manual page on a command you're curious about. Simply type man followed by the command you’re curious about; in this case it will print the possible commands for "find". Press "q" to quit and exit the manual.
apropos -> finds what man page is appropriate
en -> look at your environment
export -> export/set a new environment variable
echo -> print some arguments
xargs -> execute arguments
history -> lists all the commands entered
exit -> exits terminal
